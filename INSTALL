This file contains instructions for building "piqi" command-line executable from
source code.

Pre-built binaries can be downloaded from http://piqi.org/downloads/


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
===================

Piqi has been tested on Linux (i386 and amd64 architectures), Mac OS X and
FreeBSD. It is also known to work on Windows and Solaris.

Piqi is written in OCaml so, in theory, it should work on platforms and hardware
architectures supported by OCaml. See the list of supported platforms at

        http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/portability.en.html


PREREQUISITES
=============

1. Install OCaml and opam (package manager for OCaml)

On Debian and Ubuntu:

        apt-get install opam

On Mac OS X (using Homebrew):

        brew install ocaml opam

On other systems, see [OPAM](http://opam.ocaml.org/)

To cross-compile for Windows, see the "CROSS-COMPILATION" section below


2. Configure opam

        opam init
        eval `opam config env`


3. Install dependencies

        opam install --deps-only ./opam

        also available as "make deps" shortcut


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. Run ./configure

        Run "./configure --help" for the list of available options.

2. Build Piqi

        make

3. Install the "piqi" binary along with the "piqi.1" man page

        make install

4. (Optional) build HTML documentation -- see doc/README.md for more details

        make doc


RUNNING TESTS
=============

        make test


See tests/README for further information.


CROSS-COMPILATION
=================

To build a Windows (win64) executable on Linux/MacOsX:


1. Install OCaml cross-compiler and cross-compiled dependencies

  Follow instructions here: https://github.com/ocaml-cross/opam-cross-windows

  For example, on Mac OS X:

        brew install mingw-w64 gawk

        opam repository add windows git://github.com/ocaml-cross/opam-cross-windows
        opam switch 4.08.0
        eval `opam config env`

        opam install ocaml-windows64 sedlex-windows easy-format-windows

2. Build

        ./configure --toolchain windows
        make deps
        make
        make strip  # optional


# ex: sw=4 et
